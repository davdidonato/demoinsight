# Datadog Product Baseline (Jan 2026)

## Purpose
This document provides a normalized, end-to-end inventory of Datadog products and major capabilities as of January 2026.  
It is designed as a **baseline reference for AI-driven analysis of customer reactions during Datadog demos**, enabling consistent tagging of features, outcomes, and buyer signals.

## Observability Core

### Infrastructure Monitoring
- Host, VM, container, and cloud infrastructure metrics
- Kubernetes, serverless, and autoscaling visibility
- Unified tags across environments
- Cost-aware infrastructure correlation

**Primary outcomes:** availability, capacity planning, infra efficiency

---

### Application Performance Monitoring (APM)
- Distributed tracing
- Service maps and dependency graphs
- Latency, error, and throughput analysis
- Continuous profiler

**Primary outcomes:** performance optimization, root cause analysis

---

### Log Management
- Centralized log ingestion and indexing
- Live tail, rehydration, and archives
- Log-based metrics
- Native correlation with traces and metrics

**Primary outcomes:** troubleshooting speed, auditability

---

### Real User Monitoring (RUM)
- Browser and mobile user session tracking
- Core Web Vitals
- Session replay
- Frontend error monitoring

**Primary outcomes:** user experience optimization, frontend reliability

---

### Synthetic Monitoring
- API and browser tests
- Global test locations
- CI/CD integration
- Performance regression detection

**Primary outcomes:** proactive availability validation

---

## Cloud & Platform Engineering

- Compliance frameworks (CIS, SOC2, ISO)
- Drift detection
- Risk prioritization

---

### Cloud Workload Security (CWS)
- Runtime threat detection
- Kernel-level signals
- Workload behavioral baselining

---

### Application Security Management (ASM)

- Lock and replication analysis
- Managed DB integrations

---

### Storage Monitoring
- Block, object, and file storage performance
- Cost vs usage correlation

---

## AI & Advanced Analytics

### Bits AI
- Natural language querying
- Root cause suggestions
- Incident summarization
- Cross-product reasoning

---

### LLM Observability
- Prompt and response tracing
- Latency and cost tracking
- Model comparison
- Hallucination detection patterns

---

## Collaboration & Support

### CoScreen
- Secure screen sharing
- Remote debugging
- Embedded support workflows

---

## Platform Capabilities (Cross-Cutting)

- Unified tagging model
- OpenTelemetry native support
- 700+ integrations
- Role-based access control
- Data pipelines and routing
- Multi-region data residency

---

## AI Labeling Guidance (for Demo Analysis)

**Recommended dimensions:**
- Product(s) referenced
- Buyer persona (DevOps, SRE, Security, FinOps, Eng)
- Pain addressed (latency, risk, cost, visibility)
- Reaction signal (interest, confusion, objection, excitement)
- Competitive displacement indicator

---

## Notes
- Product naming aligns with Datadog public catalog as of Jan 2026.
- Internal sales talk tracks, pricing, and competitive positioning should be layered on top of this baseline.
- Document intentionally optimized for machine parsing and semantic tagging.
